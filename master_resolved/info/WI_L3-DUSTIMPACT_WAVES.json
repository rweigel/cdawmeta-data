    "Extended_Description": "This dataset contains dust impacts identified with the Wind/WAVES Time Domain Sampler (TDS) Fast Receiver, or (TDSF).  The TDSF receiver records two electric field components and four (commandable) sample rates ranging from ~1875--120,000 samples per second (sps) or time durations of ~17--1000 ms.  Each set of two field components for TDSF is called an event and each component is always composed of 2048 samples.  Nearly all events will be measured by the two spin-plane wire dipole antenna, where the X-antenna is ~100 m tip-to-tip and the Y-antenna is ~15 m tip-to-tip [lengths at launch] and in the 120,000 sps mode.  Some events, however, will have Z-antenna results in which case the impact antenna angles are not calculated and defined as fill values.  The output is reported by channel number with the associated antenna identified by the *_ImpactAntenna CDF variable within each file.",

        "VAR_NOTES": "The impact angle uncertainties are mostly controlled by the quadrant or hemisphere in which the dust impact occurred.  This is true for the Ch1ImpAnt_E_S_Angle and Ch2ImpAnt_E_S_Angle.  This is roughly +/- 45 degrees (i.e., quadrant) for all events.  For the other sun angles (i.e., Pos_Ax_SCS_Angle, Pos_Ax_E_S_Angle, and Pos_Ay_E_S_Angle), the uncertainty is controlled by the spin rate of the spacecraft (determined by event duration and angle subtended during an event) multiplied by the TDSF event duration plus the DPU clock latency uncertainty (i.e., ~10.6 ms).  Thus, this uncertainty is currently < 13 degrees (i.e., worst case scenario for fastest spin rate and slowest sampling rate).  In the best case scenario (i.e., most events), the uncertainties drop to ~3 degrees.",
