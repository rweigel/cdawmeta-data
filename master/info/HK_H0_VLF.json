Except for the outermost 6.1 m of each element, which had a conducting surface, the antenna was coated with Pyre-ML to electrically insulate the antenna from the surrounding plasma. The insulating coating was required to insulate the antenna from the perturbing effects of the plasma sheath surrounding the spacecraft body. At high altitudes, the thickness of the plasma sheath surrounding  the spacecraft body was quit large, on the order of 9 m. Since the conducting portion of the antenna must extend beyond the plasma sheath, it was necessary that the antenna be rather long, at least 30 m. tip-to-tip. The antenna mechanism used on HAWKEYE was the Dual-Tee extendible antenna manufactured by Fairchild Industries. The antenna length was 42.49 meters after final deployment until the last orbit, when an attempt was made to retract the antenna to reduce the spacecraft drag."
