It is demonstrated that the pointing of the IBEX-Lo star sensor and of the spacecraft star tracker agree within this prescribed accuracy for time periods of simultaneous good observations (Hlond et al., 2012). The data used from time periods when the IBEX star tracker, which provides precision pointing information for the routine data processing, was operating within its specifications for all analysis that requires exact pointing knowledge, such as the evaluation of the flow distributions in latitude. However, the determination of the ISM flow maximum in ecliptic longitude only requires the use of the count rates, obtained over plus-minus 3 sigma of the angular distribution from the latitude peak position, as a function of longitude, so this requirement can be relaxed.

This slow down produces a modulation in the high-resolution data according to the accumulation scheme into 6 deg sectors. Therefore, the only data integrated 6-deg sector for He used in this analysis. In addition, IBEX-Lo detects background electrons, which are identified as invalid events by the TOF spectrometer, but they have to be removed by the CEU, which adds to its load and the slow down when electron rates increase.

The angular distribution analysis, in general, is performed on much shorter .good. time periods than the count rate analysis because nominal operation of the star tracker is required. Because the rate analysis requires contiguous time sections of fixed length to achieve approximately comparable counting statistics for each data point, very small portions at the beginning or end of the .good. time intervals may be unused, which accounts for the occasional foreshortening of the .good. time intervals for the rate analysis at the beginning or the end.

The present CDF data set was converted from the originally archived data in ascii list format but otherwise includes no changes in the data. The original data are given in 30 rows for Solar Ecliptic Latitude and 60 columns for Solar Ecliptic East Longitude. The accompanying documentation described the row latitude data as starting from the north Ecliptic pole (+90 degrees) and decreasing in value to the south Ecliptic pole (-90 degrees). During preparation of the data set in CDF format, SPDF discovered that the correct order was increasing from row 1 for the South Ecliptic pole to row 30 for the north Ecliptic pole. East longitude is defined correctly for the column order but we have instead used west longitude to better represent the outward-looking viewpoint from IBEX to the outer heliosphere as typically used in IBEX team plots.
